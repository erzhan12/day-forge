# RULES.md

Project-specific patterns, pitfalls, and conventions discovered during development.
This is a living document — update it as new patterns emerge.

## Secrets & Environment Files

- Never commit `.env` files. `.gitignore` excludes `.env` and `.env.*`, with `!.env.example` carved out so a sanitized template can be committed.
- Secrets belong in env vars, not code or fixtures. See `backend/day_forge/settings.py` and the env var list in `CLAUDE.md` (`LLM_API_KEY`, `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, etc.).
- Before committing, sanity-check with `git ls-files | grep -E '(^|/)\.env'` — should return nothing except `.env.example` if one exists.
- User commands sent to `POST /api/ai/schedules/<date>/command/` are logged verbatim to `AIInteraction` (capped at 2 KB). Treat this table as sensitive; don't paste real secrets into the command bar while testing.

## XSS / Output Escaping

- Block titles flow user → DB → Vue. Vue's `{{ ... }}` text interpolation auto-escapes, and there is **no `v-html` usage** in `frontend/src/`. Do **not** call `django.utils.html.escape()` on titles before saving — Vue would then render `&lt;` literally, mangling legitimate inputs containing `<`, `>`, or `&`. Escape at the render boundary, not the storage boundary, and only if `v-html` is ever introduced.
- LLM-supplied strings are shape/length-validated in `backend/ai/schemas.py`. Control chars below 0x20 (excluding `\t\n\r`) are rejected to keep titles safe for downstream CSV exports and log scrapers.

## AI Undo Registration

- A `200 OK` from the AI command endpoint does **not** always mean the schedule changed. The LLM may return `actions: []` with an explanation (e.g. "outside working hours") — this is a successful interaction with zero mutations.
- Undo must be registered only when `result.data.blocks` actually differs from the pre-submit snapshot. The comparison lives in `_scheduleChanged()` in `frontend/src/components/CommandBar.vue`.
- When `data.blocks` is missing from the response, treat as no change (do not push undo) — this is the safe default.
